Laudure is a “morning huddle” platform for fine dining restaurants

Core Features:

- built for **back-of-house** staff
- agent system that automates reservation analysis
- overview → **how much** of each dish do we need today?
- volume →  **when** do demands spike?
- timeline → **what** in particular does each guest need?

## Design

### design philosophy

The only exposure I've had to restaurant management comes from watching Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen clips on YouTube. From that I imagined restaurant morning huddles functioning like basketball timeouts - high-pressure moments where every second counts. Both situations demand instant clarity that's fast, visual, and immediately useful.

Every design choice I made answers one question: how can we show what matters without overwhelming people with details? The result is a highly visual system that lets the team focus on service, not decoding information.

### information flow

My design creates a visual journey from simple to complex. The overview page provides essentials, with clarifying details revealed as you navigate deeper. Each page has a clear and defined focus.

The overview page answers how much food needs to be prepared. Everything else is intentionally abstracted away.

I used a treemap vixy separate dishes

- Box area sizes indicate relative volume needs
- The format maximizes information density at a glance

This design gives kitchen staff an instant visual snapshot of exactly what needs to be done.

The volume section introduces time as a critical variable, showing when dishes need to be prepared throughout the evening.

I chose an area chart over a stacked bar chart because it:

- Better represents the fluid, unpredictable flow of orders
- Creates distinctive silhouettes for each dish category

This chart acts like a ‘rhythm guide’ for the kitchen — a forecast of todays’ service demands.

The timeline showcases back-of-house information in one comprehensive view, answering all the “what” questions. 
Key features include: 

- Compact guest cards with agent-generated service suggestions, ranked on urgency
- Interactive service flow timeline
- Detailed filtering + printing of reservations

While previous views provide the big picture, the timeline has the specific context staff need to execute.

I represented courses with shapes: triangles for appetizers, squares for mains, and pentagons for desserts. The increasing number of sides (3→4→5) intentionally mirrors both the dining progression and the growing complexity across our interface pages. This geometric system build a mental model that’s intuitive (also its just cooler).
